# Open Claw Bot Research Brief (2026-02-18)

Project codename: kilo-mcclain-clawdbot

## Goal of this brief
Define the highest-leverage operating strategy to recreate the red paper clip challenge with an AI planner and human execution layer (`rentahuman.ai`).

## What the current market/policy data says
- `rentahuman.ai` currently positions itself as a "meatspace" execution layer where agents can book humans via MCP/REST for pickups, meetings, verification, and related physical tasks.
- RentAHuman's February 2026 bounty documentation shows a concrete `POST /api/bounties` workflow with required fields (budget, location, deadline) and proof-of-completion/payment release flow.
- The original One Red Paperclip run completed in 14 trades over one year (July 2005 to July 2006), and started by posting in Craigslist barter.
- Craigslist still has an active barter category (`/search/bar`) and explicitly moderates miscategorized, illegal, misleading, non-local, or spammy posts.
- eBay explicitly prohibits offers to buy/sell outside eBay and blocks sharing direct contact info before checkout.
- Facebook Marketplace limits listings to physical items and disallows services or "in search of" posts in Marketplace listings.
- OfferUp similarly limits for-sale feed to tangible items and has broad prohibited-item and anti-fraud restrictions.

## Optimal strategy (recommended)
1. Use a two-loop system:
   - Loop A (AI): source and score opportunities.
   - Loop B (human): execute only location-dependent tasks (inspection, pickup, handoff, shipping, verification).
2. Keep negotiations and payments inside each platform's allowed flow:
   - eBay: only in-platform checkout/messaging.
   - Facebook Marketplace/OfferUp: physical-item compliant listings; no service-style or off-policy posts.
   - Craigslist: post in correct local barter categories only.
3. Prioritize trade candidates with this rank order:
   - High `value_gain`
   - High `close_prob`
   - High `liquidity`
   - Low `fraud_risk`
   - Low `time_cost`
4. Use RentAHuman bounties to reduce cycle time:
   - Create standardized bounty templates for `inspect`, `pickup`, `meet`, `ship`.
   - Require acceptance criteria in every bounty: timestamped photos/video, serial numbers, seller handle, and receipt proof.
5. Add strict financial and legal controls from day 1:
   - Pay with reversible methods where possible (credit/marketplace protections).
   - Track fair market value at each trade leg for tax reporting.
   - Screen items for shipping restrictions before dispatch.

## Suggested 30-day execution plan
1. Days 1-3: acquire seed clip, create first 3 listings (Craigslist barter + 2 marketplace listings), start with local radius.
2. Days 4-10: execute first 2-3 trades with low-dollar, high-liquidity goods (small electronics, tools, collectibles).
3. Days 11-20: move into higher-trust categories and bundle trades to accelerate value jumps.
4. Days 21-30: focus on one "story-rich" leap item (experience, event, niche collectible) to unlock outsized publicity-driven trade value.

## Risk controls that should be non-negotiable
- Never take a transaction off-platform where policy forbids it.
- Never release payout until evidence checklist passes.
- Never ship items that violate carrier restrictions.
- Never skip FMV logging for any barter event.

## Inferences and assumptions
- Inference: RentAHuman is currently fast-moving and early-stage (public docs/blog dated February 2026), so adapter abstractions and graceful fallback providers are important.
- Inference: The fastest path to value growth is not just price arbitrage; it is story-driven deal selection plus low-latency physical execution.
